# Syndra Engine

Syndra is an early-stage 3D game engine with a focus on real-time rendering. Syndra uses **OpenGL** graphics API and is being developed for windows platform.

# Motivation
Syndra is my bachelor's thesis project, where I wanted to study how to build 3D game engines. The purpose of this project is not to make 3D games; rather, my primary motivation for making Syndra is to test and learn new algorithms and techniques used mainly in graphics and real-time rendering. Also, I've made this project open source, hoping that it would be useful to someone.

# Compiling
Syndra only supports windows for now.
Visual Studio 2019 is recommended.

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/ErfanMo77/Syndra-Engine`.
If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use `git submodule update --init` to clone the necessary submodules.

Syndra requires vulkan sdk to compile shaders, so first, you have to run **scripts/setup.py** to install vulkan sdk on your device.
Then, you can execute GenerateProjects.bat to generate visual studio solution file and compile the engine.
