# Syndra Engine

Syndra is an early-stage 3D real-time rendering engine being developed for windows platform.

## Motivation
Syndra is my university's final year project and I wanted to study how to build 3d game engines.

## Getting Syndra
Syndra only supports windows for now.
Visual Studio 2019 is recommended.

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/ErfanMo77/Syndra-Engine`.

If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use `git submodule update --init` to clone the necessary submodules.

Then, you can execute GenerateProjects.bat to generate visual studio solution file.

There is also a ready to use build version of syndra available at [Syndra Build](https://github.com/ErfanMo77/Syndra-Build).
