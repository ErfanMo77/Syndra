# Compiling
Syndra only supports windows for now.
Visual Studio 2019 is recommended.

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/ErfanMo77/Syndra-Engine`.
If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use `git submodule update --init` to clone the necessary submodules.

Syndra requires vulkan sdk to compile shaders, so first, you have to run **scripts/setup.py** to install vulkan sdk on your device.
Then, you can execute GenerateProjects.bat to generate visual studio solution file.


# Dependencies
